# Major Program 1 Errata

** Red parts of the screenshot are items removed from the instructions, and green parts are items added to the instructions. **

## Update 1

1. Correct the `TimeBlock` UML comments

Previously, a comment on the `TimeBlock` constructor asked the student to instantiate an `ArrayList` when none existed.

2. Update input file format

The input file format was amended to include all `TimeBlock` properties on a single line, separated by a comma. Input file format instructions are now consistent with the given input file.

4. Add `Course` class to level 2 requirements.
